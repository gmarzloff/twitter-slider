# Twitter Slider
*A plug-in to populate your tweets into a slider for use on a personal website*
***

## Introduction
There are 2 parts to this project. 

1. The first part is a node script `index.js` that uses the twitter API to fetch statuses from a user. For tweets referring to links, the script attempts to follow them to find metadata used to make the "summary cards" (image, title, description, etc). Finally, the script saves the tweets to a file (www/tweets.json by default). The index.js script uses (node-crontab)[https://github.com/NineCollective/node-crontab] to run and update the tweet file every 30 minutes (user customizable).

2. The second part is the front-end slider in the www folder. It parses the json file generated by node and renders the object data into a (Lean-Slider)[https://github.com/gilbitron/Lean-Slider]. 

## Installation

1. Clone the project
2. Run ``` npm install ```

## Generate JSON data source 
1. The node script is designed to run in the server background and can be run with (forever)[https://github.com/foreverjs/forever] to accomplish this. 

```
$ npm install forever -g

$ cd the/path/of/twitter-slider
$ forever start index.js
```

The tweet objects produced in the json have the following structure:
